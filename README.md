# Comparing Classification Models for Bank Term Deposit Prediction

## Business Objective
A Portuguese bank wants to identify which customers are likely to subscribe to a term deposit product after telemarketing contact. Accurately targeting customers allows the bank to:

- Increase conversion rates
- Reduce wasted calls and labor costs
- Improve marketing ROI and customer satisfaction

We will compare four models:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The chosen model must not only perform well, but also handle class imbalance and provide actionable insights.


## Overview
This project compares KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and SVMs on the UCI Bank Marketing dataset to predict term deposit subscription.


## Files
- `bank_classifiers_comparison.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and modeling.
- `data/bank-additional-full.csv` - dataset (not included in repo if size is large; provide data source link).
- `outputs/` - contains result CSVs and PNG plots generated by notebook.

### EDA Summary
- The target variable (`y`) is highly imbalanced — most customers do not subscribe.
- Customers span a wide age range, with ~30–60 being most common.
- Jobs like administrative, services, and technicians dominate the dataset.
- Economic indicators show correlations but no single dominant predictor.
- Imbalance means accuracy alone is not sufficient — we will emphasize F1 and recall.

# Final Insights & Recommendations
## Model Performance Summary
| Model | Best Metric | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Good generalization, interpretable | Best for business use & explainability |
| KNN | Moderate | Struggles with high-dimensional categorical data |
| Decision Tree | Overfits by default | Useful for feature insight, needs regularization |
| SVM | Highest tuned accuracy, slower | Best predictive model, low interpretability |

## Selected Model
**Logistic Regression** chosen for business deployment due to balance of accuracy, speed, and interpretability.  
**SVM** recommended for batch scoring pipeline when accuracy priority > interpretability.

## Why This Matters
The bank can:
- Reduce wasted marketing calls
- Target likely subscribers
- Increase conversion rate and campaign ROI
Even a **5% lift in targeting accuracy** yields substantial cost savings in large-scale telemarketing campaigns.

## Next Steps
- Test additional models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Calibrate probabilities for business scoring
- Deploy pilot program and measure call-conversion lift
- Monitor model drift and retrain quarterly
  
## Key findings & recommendations
- Baseline accuracy (majority guess): 0.887
- Default models: see outputs/model_comparison_defaults.csv for metrics and training time.
- After hyperparameter tuning, top performing models (by F1 / ROC AUC): see outputs/tuned_model_results.csv.
- Class imbalance: subscription rate is low; use metrics like recall, precision, F1, and ROC AUC.
- Important features often include: duration (if used), campaign, previous contact result (poutcome), euribor3m, and nr.employed (these may vary by model).
- Decision trees can provide interpretable feature importances, logistic regression coefficients give directionality, and SVM often gives high accuracy at higher compute cost.
