# Bank Marketing - Comparing Classifiers (Practical Application 17.1)

## Overview
This project compares KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and SVMs on the UCI Bank Marketing dataset to predict term deposit subscription.

## Files
- `bank_classifiers_comparison.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and modeling.
- `data/bank-additional-full.csv` - dataset (not included in repo if size is large; provide data source link).
- `outputs/` - contains result CSVs and PNG plots generated by notebook.

## Key findings & recommendations
- Baseline accuracy (majority guess): 0.887
- Default models: see outputs/model_comparison_defaults.csv for metrics and training time.
- After hyperparameter tuning, top performing models (by F1 / ROC AUC): see outputs/tuned_model_results.csv.
- Class imbalance: subscription rate is low; use metrics like recall, precision, F1, and ROC AUC.
- Important features often include: duration (if used), campaign, previous contact result (poutcome), euribor3m, and nr.employed (these may vary by model).
- Decision trees can provide interpretable feature importances, logistic regression coefficients give directionality, and SVM often gives high accuracy at higher compute cost.
